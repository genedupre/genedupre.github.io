        <h1>OPTIONS</h1>

        <div>Here are some of my hobbies that I do with my spare time.</div>

        <div>
            <details>
                <summary>--Motorcycle-Driving</summary>
                <div>Motorcycle-driving is my big passion and after many years of touring around europe, I have achieved a large amount of nice memories doing so.</div>
                <div>In 2018 I drove from Belgium all the way to Finland, Tampere to visit a friend. In 2019 I drove all the way to Poland Warsaw, passing Berlin, Prague, Brno, Kraków and Lódź along the way.</div>
		<div>At some point in the future I will use my personal blog to write my experiences on driving very long distances with a motorcycle to help new drivers gain insight in long distance driving.</div>
            </details>
            
            <details>
               <summary>--Books</summary>
                <div>I love reading books whenever I have the time for it. My two most favorite books would be E.B Sledge With the old breed and Jordan B. Peterson 12 rules for life.  </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>--Powerlifting</summary>
                <div>I started training when I was 16 years old. over the course of time i experimented with different disciplines and diets. I ended up loving the Powerlifting discipline the most and its techniques.</div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>--Food</summary>
                <div>I have an absolute passion for cooking, and it is a big source of relaxation to be behind cooking fires and creating your favorite meals.</div>
                <div>My favorite meal would be self-made hamburgers, they are simply the best.</div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>--Music</summary>
                <div>I love a wide range of music and I do put a lot of effort in maintaining a high quality personal music library. Though I have to confess that my all time favorite album would be Random Access Memories from Daft Punk.</div>

                <summary>--Pets</summary>
                <div>In the beginning of covid I got the pleasure of having Martin in my life. Martin is an King Charles Cavalier and as any cavalier dog, he is very kind, very active and mostly very affectionate.</div>
		<div>Once the borders started going open again, he left to Guatemala to his permanent owners where he will have the perfect dog life, running around with others dogs in a big garden and being a professional show dog.</div>
